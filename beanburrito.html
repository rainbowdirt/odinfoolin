<br> You thought there was going to be food, but instead it's just Kurry wanting dat ass.
<br><br>
I never use paragraph codes, only br's. Paragraphs get all wonky and I don't like them. Also, idk why anyone would use the coded list thing. Like... 
<br>
<br>Why do this
<ul>
<li>Kurry</li>
<li>Curry</li>
<li>Conrad</li>
<li>Kurtis</li>
    </ul>

When you can just...
<br>- Beans
<br>- Cake
<br>- Cheese
<br>- This is so much easier and faster to type without all those stupidass auto-complete bullshit things popping up and me having to pick up my mouse and move it to the end of the stupid shitty effing autocompleted code that I FREAKING HATE IT SO MUCH
<br>- And tbh, it looks almost as nice. And you could just copy+paste the code for the lil dots anyway since they'll show up with the utf coding thing, so wtf.
<br>- Why would anyone use those coded lists. 8||||

<br><br>Kurr Approach to Love:
<ol>
<li>Identify cute lehmori</li>
<li>Talk to cute lehmori</li>
<li>Assess gayness of cute lehmori</li>
<li>Be confused</li>
<li>Fail</li>
</ol>

Okay, there, I used the list things that I hate. Never again. xD
